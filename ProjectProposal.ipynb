    "This question is of interest because with the emergence of the Warriors as a powerhouse in the NBA, the conversation of shooting a large amount of three-pointers as an effective offensive plan has gained steam. When listening to the opinion of multiple sports commentaters, everyone seems to have a different opinion on whether the style of play that emphasizes the three pointer is truly more effective than the traditional offensive plan of focusing on closer shots. \n",
    "\n",
    "The background information we have taken into consideration when predicting the number of three point shots has increased over time is the fact that commentators often speak of how the game is evolving away from the center being the most prominent position to the guard, since in the current NBA, shooting has become a much more emphasized skill. In addition, with the style of play of the Warriors, the most recent NBA champions, and other teams in the NBA, it seems as though teams are starting to make the three-pointer a more critical part of the offense. In addition, we do not believe this increase in attempts actually leads to a more effective offensive strategy which we measure in terms of win percentage because while a three-pointer leads to more points, it is a more difficult shot with a lower field-goal percentage. Hence, we believe that trading in a normal field goal which has a higher chance of going in with a three-pointer actually offsets the effectiveness of the offense, in turn not providing a positive correlation to win percentage. \n",

    "    In order to analyze the effectiveness of the 3 point shot, we need to normalize the data across each season. This is because we need to control for a difference in 3 point attempts year to year. We will attempt to do this by comparing the number of 3 point attempts in each year with the 3 point attempt average for each specific year. This way, the predicted increase in 3 point attempts throughout the decades will not affect the weight each 3 point attempt has on win percentage. \n",
    "    To compare the data about the three point shots attempted over time, we will aggregate the data of the number of three point shots of each team per game for every season since 1979.

    "If our analyses and hypotheses are correct, our project may suggest methods that an arbitrary basketball team can use to be successful. The results may explain why, if there is, an increase in the number of 3 point attempts over the past few decades of NBA history. We assume that the analysts of these various NBA teams will have conclusions very similar to the ones we will make after analyzing the data, and thus our conclusions will be relevant to how NBA teams play in the modern age.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if our analyses and hypotheses are wrong, there are two reasons for this to happen: if there is either no correlation, and if there is a negative correlation. If there is no correlation, then we know that any increase in 3 point attempts has no relation to winning percentage, and there may be some other underlying factor or potentially too many variables in general to determine how a team can win. If there is a negative correlation, it may allow us to propose other conclusions. If our methods don't work, then we will propose new methods to use and test them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential pitfalls for us are our own personal biases on the interpretation of the data. Since we are proposing our own hypothesis, we might give more weight to the data that supports our claims. We should not look for confirmation of our hypothesis, but rather form an objective conclusion and compare it to our hypothesis afterwards. There might also be strange data that will be hard to explain, and skew our data. "
